## Summary and Confidence Level

This research provides a detailed overview of the primary international money transfer services available in Aden, Yemen. The information on Western Union and MoneyGram agents is relatively comprehensive, with specific agent names and locations identified. However, the information for Ria Money Transfer is less detailed due to the inability to access the CAC Bank's branch locator. The other mentioned services require further investigation to confirm their presence and operational details in Aden.

**Confidence Level: Medium**

The confidence level is rated as medium. While the information for Western Union and MoneyGram is sourced directly from their respective websites, the lack of complete data for Ria and other services, along with the absence of specific pricing details in Yemeni Rial and WhatsApp numbers, prevents a high confidence rating. Further on-the-ground verification would be necessary to achieve a high level of confidence.
