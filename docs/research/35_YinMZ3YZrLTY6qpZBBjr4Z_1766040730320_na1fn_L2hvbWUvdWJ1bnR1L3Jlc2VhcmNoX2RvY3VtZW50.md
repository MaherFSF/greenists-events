## 1. Workflow for Booking a Henna Artist

This workflow outlines the step-by-step process for a user to book a henna artist through the Greenists platform.

1.  **Artist Selection:** The user navigates to the henna artist section of the platform. They can browse through a curated list of artists, viewing their portfolios which include images of their work, traditional designs, and bridal packages. Each artist profile also displays their pricing and availability.
2.  **Package Selection:** Once an artist is chosen, the user selects from the available packages. These could range from intricate bridal packages to simpler traditional designs for other occasions.
3.  **Event Details:** The user is prompted to provide essential details for the booking, including the date, time, and location of the event where the henna service is required.
4.  **Availability Confirmation:** The platform's system automatically checks the selected artist's calendar to confirm their availability for the specified date and time. If the artist is unavailable, the user is prompted to select another artist or time.
5.  **Payment:** To secure the booking, the user is required to make a payment. This could be a partial deposit or the full amount, processed securely through the platform's integrated payment gateway.
6.  **Booking Confirmation:** Upon successful payment, the user receives an instant booking confirmation. This confirmation includes all the relevant details of the booking: artist name, selected package, event date and time, location, and payment receipt.
7.  **Pre-event Reminder:** To ensure a smooth experience, the system sends an automated reminder to the user a few days prior to the event.
