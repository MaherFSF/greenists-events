**Date:** 2025-12-18

**Author:** Manus AI

## 1. Summary of Key Findings

This report details the legal and administrative requirements for hosting events in Aden, Yemen. The primary government body responsible for issuing permits for events, particularly those involving civil society organizations and international partners, is the **Office of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC)** in Aden. While a specific law for business events has not been identified, the existing legal framework for public gatherings provides some guidance. The process is reportedly bureaucratic and lengthy, but efforts are underway to digitize and streamline it.

## 2. Primary Government Authority

The main entity for event permits in Aden is the **Office of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC)**.

| Information | Details |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Name (English):** | Office of Planning and International Cooperation |
| **Name (Arabic):** | مكتب التخطيط والتعاون الدولي |
| **Address:** | Aden, Yemen (Specific address not found) |
| **Email:** | info@mopic-aden.org |

| **Website:** | [https://mopic-aden.org/](https://mopic-aden.org/) |

**Confidence:** High. Multiple sources confirm MOPIC's role in event permits, and the official website provides contact information.

## 3. Legal Framework

No specific law governing private business events was found. However, **Law No. (29) of 2003 regarding the organization of demonstrations and marches** provides some insight into the government's approach to public gatherings. This law primarily targets political demonstrations but includes a clause (Article 19) that exempts 'gatherings for demands' as long as they do not escalate into a demonstration. This suggests that a standard business event might not fall under this law's strict notification requirements. However, given the current political climate and the mention of a bureaucratic process, it is highly probable that some form of notification or permit is required.

**Confidence:** Medium. The applicability of the existing law to business events is an interpretation. A direct consultation with MOPIC is recommended to confirm the exact legal requirements.

## 4. Step-by-Step Process (Hypothesized)

Based on the information about the development of an automated system, the process likely involves the following steps. This is a hypothesized workflow and should be verified with MOPIC.

1.  **Initial Contact:** Reach out to MOPIC via email or phone to inquire about the specific requirements for a business event.
2.  **Application Submission:** Submit a formal application. With the new automated system, this will likely be an online process.
3.  **Document Submission:** Provide all required documentation (see next section).
4.  **Review and Approval:** MOPIC will review the application and documents. This is the stage described as being lengthy and bureaucratic.
5.  **Permit Issuance:** If approved, a permit for the event will be issued.

## 5. Required Documents (Hypothesized)

The following documents are likely to be required, based on standard practices for such permits:

*   Official letter of request detailing the event's purpose, date, time, location, and expected number of attendees.
*   Copy of the commercial registration of the organizing entity.
*   Identification documents of the event organizers.
*   A detailed agenda of the event.
*   Any other documents requested by MOPIC.

**Confidence:** Low. This is a generalized list and the actual requirements must be confirmed with MOPIC.

## 6. Fees and Charges

No information regarding specific fees for event permits was found. It is possible that fees are determined on a case-by-case basis. It is also possible that there are no official fees, but unofficial payments may be expected to expedite the process.

**Pricing:**
*   **YER:** To be determined.
*   **USD:** To be determined.

**Confidence:** Low.

## 7. Recommendations

*   **Direct Engagement:** The most critical step is to establish direct contact with the Office of Planning and International Cooperation (MOPIC) in Aden. Use the provided email and phone number to get first-hand information.
*   **Allow Ample Time:** Given the reports of a bureaucratic and lengthy process, it is crucial to start the permit application process well in advance of the planned event date.
*   **Local Partner:** Consider engaging a local partner or consultant in Aden who is familiar with the administrative procedures. This can significantly streamline the process.
*   **Monitor the New System:** Keep an eye on the launch of the new automated system for event permits. This should simplify the process once it is operational.
