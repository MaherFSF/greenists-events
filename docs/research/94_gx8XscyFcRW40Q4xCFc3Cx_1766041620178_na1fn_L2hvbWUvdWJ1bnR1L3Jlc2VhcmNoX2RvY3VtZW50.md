## Phase 2: Detailed Research and Data Extraction

Further research has revealed significant challenges and complexities in obtaining permits for public events in Aden. The security and political situation has led to a restrictive environment for civil society and public gatherings.

### Key Findings:

*   **De Facto Authorities:** The Southern Transitional Council (STC) exercises de facto control in Aden and has implemented its own set of rules for public activities, which are not always aligned with the official Yemeni law.
*   **Permit Requirements:** According to a report by Amnesty International, organizations are now required to obtain permits from two STC-run entities:
    *   **STC-run Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour**
    *   **STC-run National Authority for Southern Media**
*   **Onerous Reporting:** The permit application process is described as "onerous" and requires detailed reports on planned activities, including:
    *   Place, time, and purpose of the activity
    *   Number of participants
    *   Source of funding
    *   Expected outcomes
    *   In some cases, a list of participants' names.
*   **Arbitrary Enforcement:** The enforcement of these rules appears to be arbitrary, with some events being shut down even after a permit has been obtained. Organizations not politically aligned with the STC face greater scrutiny.
*   **No Centralized Information:** There is no clear, centralized source of information or official website detailing these new protocols. The information gathered so far comes from news articles and reports from NGOs.

### Next Steps:

*   Attempt to find contact information for the STC-run Ministry of Social Affairs and Labour and the National Authority for Southern Media.
*   Search for any online presence or official decrees from the STC related to event management.
*   Consolidate all findings into a structured format for the final report.


### Conclusion:

The research indicates that there is no straightforward, officially documented process for obtaining event permits for government-related events in Aden. The political situation, with the STC exerting de facto control, has created a complex and fluid regulatory environment. The process is not transparent and appears to be highly politicized. Any organization planning to host events in Aden, especially those of a public or political nature, will need to engage directly with the STC-run authorities and be prepared for a bureaucratic and potentially arbitrary process. The information gathered should be considered a starting point, and on-the-ground contacts and legal counsel would be essential for navigating this landscape successfully.
