# Research on Furniture Rental Services in Aden, Yemen

This document presents the findings of research conducted on furniture rental companies in Aden, Yemen, for the Greenists event management platform. The research aimed to identify local suppliers of tables, chairs, and tents, and to gather information on their inventory, pricing, and contact details.

## Research Findings

The investigation into the Aden furniture rental market has revealed a significant lack of readily available online information. While several web searches were conducted using both English and Arabic keywords, the results were sparse and often led to businesses that were not directly relevant to event furniture rental. The following table summarizes the key entities that were investigated:

| Company Name (Arabic Name) | Category | Services | Location | Contact Information | Pricing | Source | Confidence | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Al-Bazi for Printing and Advertising (البزي للطباعة والاعلان) | Event Planner, Printing, Advertising | Printing on cloth bags, advertising services | Aden, Yemen | +967 777 739 3XX | 90 YER | [OpenSooq](https://ye.opensooq.com/en/search/273210597) | Medium | While listed under 'Event Planners', their primary service is not furniture rental. The provided price is for printed bags. Further inquiry is needed to determine if they offer furniture rental services. |
| Arabian Furniture (المفروشات العربية) | Furniture Store | Sells furniture | 90 Street, Aden, Yemen | +967-02-354-980, info@arabianfur.com | N/A | [arabianfur.com](http://www.arabianfur.com/) | Low | This is a furniture store, not a rental service. The website is outdated and the contact page is broken, making it an unreliable option. |

## Conclusion and Recommendations

The research indicates a very limited online presence for furniture rental companies in Aden, Yemen. The primary sources of information, such as online business directories and marketplaces, did not yield any direct leads for companies specializing in event furniture rental. The most promising lead, Al-Bazi for Printing and Advertising, is not a confirmed furniture rental provider.

Given the lack of readily available information, it is recommended to engage in on-the-ground research in Aden to identify and verify local suppliers. This could involve contacting event planners, visiting local markets, and making direct inquiries within the local business community.
