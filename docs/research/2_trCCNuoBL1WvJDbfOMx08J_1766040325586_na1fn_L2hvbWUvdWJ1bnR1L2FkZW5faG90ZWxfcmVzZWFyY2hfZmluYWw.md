# Research on Aden Hotel (historic) - Crater, Aden

## 1. Executive Summary

This research aimed to gather information about a historic hotel named "Aden Hotel" located in the Crater district of Aden, Yemen. Our investigation revealed that while there was a historic "Aden Hotel," it was not located in Crater but in Steamer Point. The hotel underwent several name changes, with its last known name being the **Marina Hotel**. 

In the Crater district, the most prominent hotel is the **Crater Palace Hotel**. While it is a major landmark in the area, there is no definitive evidence to suggest it is the same entity as the historic "Aden Hotel" or that it is a historic hotel in its own right. 

This document provides details on both the historic **Aden Hotel (Marina Hotel)** and the **Crater Palace Hotel** to offer a comprehensive overview of the hotel landscape in Aden, given the ambiguity of the initial request.

## 2. The Historic Aden Hotel (Marina Hotel)

### 2.1. History and Location

The original "Aden Hotel" was established in **1841** in the **Steamer Point** district of Aden, on a street known as "The Crescent." It was not located in Crater. The hotel's name was changed to "The Prince of Wales Hotel" in the same year to commemorate the birth of the Prince of Wales. Over the years, it was also known as "Hôtel De L'Europe" and finally, the **"Marina Hotel"** [1].

### 2.2. Status

Historical records and photographs from the 1960s show the Marina Hotel as a prominent establishment in Aden [2]. However, its current status is unclear. It is likely that the hotel is no longer in operation under this name, and the building may have been repurposed or demolished.

## 4. Conclusion and Recommendations

The user's request for information about a historic "Aden Hotel" in Crater appears to be based on a conflation of two different hotels. The historic "Aden Hotel" was located in Steamer Point and was last known as the Marina Hotel. The most prominent hotel in Crater is the Crater Palace Hotel, for which limited public information is available.

For the Greenists Event Management Platform, we recommend the following:

1.  **Clarify the target hotel:** If the user is interested in a *historic* venue, further research into the former Marina Hotel building in Steamer Point would be necessary to determine its current state and potential for events.
2.  **Direct outreach to Crater Palace Hotel:** To obtain details about facilities, event spaces, and pricing for the Crater Palace Hotel, direct contact will be necessary.
