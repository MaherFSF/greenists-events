## Introduction to Yemeni Weddings

Yemeni weddings are vibrant, multi-day celebrations steeped in rich cultural and religious traditions. They are not merely a union of two individuals but a significant social event that brings together families and communities. These weddings are characterized by their elaborate rituals, distinct gender-segregated celebrations, traditional attire, music, and dance. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of Yemeni wedding traditions, with a specific focus on providing actionable information for the Greenists event management platform in Aden, Yemen.

## Pre-Wedding Traditions and Rituals

The journey to a Yemeni wedding begins long before the actual ceremony. The pre-wedding rituals are a testament to the importance of family and community in Yemeni culture.

### The Proposal

The process commences with the groom's family paying a formal visit to the bride's family to ask for her hand in marriage. This is a highly significant event where the groom's mother typically presents the bride with a gift of gold jewelry. The dowry, a crucial component of the marriage agreement, is also discussed and agreed upon during this visit. The dowry, which can be a substantial amount (often cited as $5,000 or more), is paid by the groom's family to the bride's father and is considered the bride's property, providing her with a degree of financial security [1].

### The Betrothal

Once the proposal is accepted, a betrothal feast is held, usually on a Thursday or Friday. The groom's family brings gifts such as raisins and qat. The engagement ring is formally presented, and the bride price is finalized. This ceremony solidifies the commitment between the two families.

## The Wedding Celebrations

Yemeni weddings are known for their extended celebrations, which are strictly segregated by gender.

### Men's Celebrations

The men's festivities typically last for three days. They are held in large tents erected in the groom's neighborhood or in rented halls. The traditional attire for men is the "Thoob," a loose, ankle-length white garment. A highlight of the men's celebration is the "bara'a," a traditional dance performed with a "Jambia," a ceremonial dagger worn around the waist [1].

### Women's Celebrations

The women's celebrations are even more extensive, lasting for a full week. Each day has a specific theme and dress code:

| Day | Dress Code |
| :-- | :--- |
| 1 | Silver dress and silver jewelry |
| 2 | Gold dress and gold jewelry |
| 3 (Henna Day) | Green dress; henna application on hands and feet |
| 4 | Red dress with gold jewelry |
| 5 | Casual attire |
| 6 & 7 | Two different white dresses |

## The Wedding Day: "Laylat az-Zaffa"

The culmination of the wedding celebrations is "Laylat az-Zaffa," the main wedding event, which is held on a Friday. The day begins with the preparation of a grand feast. Before the midday meal, the groom, dressed in traditional attire and carrying a golden sword, is accompanied by a procession of singing and dancing men to the mosque for prayers. In the afternoon, male guests gather to chew qat and smoke the "narghile" (water pipe), while a poet recites traditional verses and musicians play the lute [2].
